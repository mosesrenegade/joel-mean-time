Joel-mean-time
--------------
Absolutely the worst idea on the planet.

- Beers with Talos Episode with Joel suggestion that we should all wake up and work 9GMT to 5GMT.

- He also got EST/CST conversion wrong. CST was on hour ahead of EST, I believe that may be carribean time which we all want to go to.

- JMT == EST +1 hour. We are always late.

	Joel wants to abolish timezones as his main party platforms. The following tool will help you understand the new jmt standard (Joel mean time).
	<p>
	The Current Time:</br>
	UTC: {{utc}}</br>
	JMT: {{jmt}} <- New Joel mean time standard</br>
	EST: {{est}}</br>
	CST: Irrelevant (obviously)</br>
	MST: Irrelevant, but ironically</br>
	PST: {{pst}}</br>
	</p>
	
	According to the new format you should only work between 09:00 to 17:00 UTC. You {{"should be at work" if work else "probably are mising a meeting"}}.
